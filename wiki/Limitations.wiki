#summary Probatron limitations

= XPath 1.0 only =

Probatron currently uses an XPath 1.0 engine to evaluate XML documents, therefore schema XPaths must conform to XPath 1.0 syntax.

If your schema root element specifies the `queryBinding` attribute, this *must* have the (case-insensitive) value "`xpath`".
